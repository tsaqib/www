I'm the CTO of Brainstation-23, a 150-engineer local software elite.

__Previously:__ 

I was Microsoftie for more than 3 years. I won prestigious Microsoft MVP awards consecutively.

I helped British Telecom, as a Technical Architect. I also worked for VC-backed Silicon Valley-based startup called Pageflakes, and in Vancouver called Sitemasher. The former was acquired by LiveUniverse, and the latter was by Salesforce.

I not only have a very strong technical background and experience in delivering complex solutions under tight deadlines and inevitable ambiguity, but also have exposure to the business of software. On top of that, I've championed technical community with more than 150 talks.

I embraced open source.
