Previously I have written [how to install and configure CouchDB from VM Depot]({% post_url 2015-05-25-crud-couchdb-nodejs %}) on Ubuntu VM which was quite an automated process. In this post, I wish to record how to install and configure CouchDB on a fresh Ubuntu VM installation inside Azure. Rest of the post can be found where I first published it on my [previous blog](https://tanzimsaqib.wordpress.com/2015/06/12/installing-couchdb-manually-on-ubuntuazure/).
