In this post, I have shown how to build a platform-agnostic, continuous server-side functional test automation infrastructure that can test just about any website regardless of the server hosted, application platform and operating systems used, on & off Azure, using JavaScript which is the most open scripting language on this planet now.

Rest of the post can be found where I first published it on my [previous blog](https://tanzimsaqib.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/continuous-functional-test-automation-with-gulp-mocha-request-cheerio-chai/).
