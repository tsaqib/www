Some of the hardward posts that I made earlier to another blog I really like, as I started out with simple [LED blinking](https://tanzimsaqib.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/hello-blinking-led/) and [blinking a BiPolar LED](https://tanzimsaqib.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/blinking-bipolar-led/), to even more meaningful [moving a car forward and backward](https://tanzimsaqib.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/moving-a-car-forwardbackward/).
