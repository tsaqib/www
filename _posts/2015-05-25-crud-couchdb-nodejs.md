There was no complete end to end CRUD on [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) along with explanation on the internet. Therefore, I took the time to take that journey on Azure and documented along the way. Rest of the post can be found where I first published it on my [previous blog](https://tanzimsaqib.wordpress.com/2015/05/25/crud-with-couchdb-in-node-js/).
