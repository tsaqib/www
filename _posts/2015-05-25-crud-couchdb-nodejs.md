When I was approaching MEAN stack, obviously MongoDB was a natural choice, but due to coming from a RDBMS background, I was into more RDBMS sort of production deployment style of a NoSQL database. Ensuring security of MongoDB on production seemed to me a nightmare, or perhaps I was simply too lazy to find a more convenient way out. I just wanted to implement old-school user/pass authentication way of securing a public database. [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) does just that. Another selling point to me was that CouchDB exposes a true REST endpoint, which feels even more natural to me especially since I was approaching the *EAN stack.

Rest of the post can be found where I first published it on my [previous blog](https://tanzimsaqib.wordpress.com/2015/05/25/crud-with-couchdb-in-node-js/).
